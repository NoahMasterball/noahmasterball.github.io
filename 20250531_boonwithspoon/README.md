# Class-Based Game Workspace

## Overview

This is a modern, class-based JavaScript game workspace designed for easy development, maintenance, and AI-assisted modifications. The game features multiple levels with different themes and mechanics, all built using object-oriented programming principles.

## Game Features

- **Multi-Level Gameplay**: Automatically generated levels with unique themes
- **Class-Based Architecture**: Modular, maintainable code structure
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, animated interface with multiple screens
- **Audio Management**: Built-in sound system
- **Event-Driven System**: Decoupled components for easy modifications

## Quick Start

1. **Open the game**: Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. **Start playing**: Use the main menu to begin the game
3. **Controls**: Arrow keys or WASD for movement
4. **Objective**: Navigate through levels, avoid enemies, reach the goal

## Game Levels

### Level 1: Classic Maze

- Moving enemies with AI
- Darkness overlay for challenge
- Goal: Reach the exit

### Level 2: Forest Adventure
- Forest-themed environment
- Different enemy types
- Environmental obstacles
- Goal: Find the forest exit

## Development Features

### Class-Based Architecture
- Each game component is a separate class
- Easy to modify individual features without affecting others
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable for additional levels and features

### AI-Friendly Structure
- Well-documented code
- Modular design
- Clear file naming conventions
- Separated concerns for easy understanding

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Mobile browsers**: Responsive design included

## Performance

The game is optimized for smooth performance:
- Efficient rendering using requestAnimationFrame
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- CSS-based animations
- Event throttling for input handling

## Customization

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new levels
- Modify existing gameplay mechanics
- Change visual themes
- Add new enemy types
- Implement new features

## File Structure

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed information about the codebase structure and what each file does.

## Contributing
